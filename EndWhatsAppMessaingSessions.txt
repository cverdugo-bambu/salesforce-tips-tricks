I have used a combination of salesforce actions and einstein bots to finish session. 
Create logic in einstein bot, for example End Chat for All incoming sessions. 

Have scheduled flow in salesforce that gets all messaging sessions you want to end. Use the "Route to 'Specific Bot" default actions. Do a for loop within flow to send the messaging session id as the recordid variable within the Route action
